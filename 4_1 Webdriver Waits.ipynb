    "[`WebDriverWait`](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html) is a *class* in the **Selenium Python library** that *allows code to wait for elements to appear on a page or for certain conditions to be met before proceeding with the execution*. It is used to wait for a specified amount of time for an element to be present on the page before interacting with it. This can be useful in situations where elements on a page may take longer to load or may be generated dynamically by `JavaScript`."
